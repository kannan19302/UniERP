# Tenant Admin Traceability

| Requirement | Control | Implementation evidence | Test evidence | Status | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TAD-BR-001 | session-derived tenant scope | auth/SDK dependencies and tenant settings routes | not mapped | UNVERIFIED | inspect API and RLS enforcement |
| TAD-BR-004 | provider/tenant separation | separate PAO and TAD apps; provider-only `settings/super-admin` pages and module removed from tenant-admin | `check:control-center-boundaries` reports zero provider-route violations | VERIFIED | keep boundary gate mandatory |
| TAD-FR-008 | canonical OCC application boundaries | 22 OCC entries in `unierp-contracts` catalog and tenant shell manifest | catalog, manifest and route-ownership gates | VERIFIED | application-level behavior remains traced separately |
| TAD-FR-009 | provider controls excluded from OCC | route ownership registry rejects provider patterns and exact migrated routes | boundary gate plus successful tenant-admin production build without super-admin routes | VERIFIED | extend negative API authorization tests |
| TAD-FR-010 | shared application manifest contract | `unierp-contracts/src/control-center-manifest.ts`; OCC launcher consumes active manifests | `check:control-center-manifests`; tenant manifest unit tests | VERIFIED | migrate legacy permissions to canonical namespaces |
| TAD-FR-002 | access-control model | access-control matrix/packages/roles routes | not mapped | UNVERIFIED | map permissions and negative tests |
| TAD-FR-003 | IAM platform contracts | SSO/MFA/session/password routes; IDP services exist | IDP unit tests observed | PARTIAL | tenant end-to-end policy tests |
| TAD-SEC-004 | secret lifecycle | API-key/integration routes observed | not identified | UNVERIFIED | inspect storage and response schemas |
| TAD-UX-005 | design system | shared UI dependency declared | no a11y evidence mapped | PARTIAL | workflow-level WCAG proof |

## Requirement coverage gaps

These requirements are linked to their owning architecture and live repository baseline, but behavioral proof has not yet been mapped. They remain gaps, not implemented claims.
