# Marketing Site Traceability

| Requirement | Architecture/control | Implementation evidence | Test evidence | Status | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MAR-BR-001 | owned lifecycle/state model | `marketing-site` inspected | not fully mapped | UNVERIFIED | generate lifecycle inventory |
| MAR-BR-002 | tenant/audit controls | relevant source signals observed | coverage not proven | PARTIAL | map isolation and audit tests |
| MAR-FR-001 | platform service/UI flow | implementation files observed | test inventory counted | UNVERIFIED | inspect behavioral assertions |
| MAR-API-001 | published schemas and errors | package/controller/type signals observed | contract coverage not mapped | PARTIAL | generate endpoint-contract matrix |
| MAR-SEC-001 | IAM policy enforcement | auth/guard usage not fully inventoried | negative tests not mapped | UNVERIFIED | create permission matrix |
| MAR-UX-004 | shared design/accessibility | UI dependency/use not fully measured | workflow evidence not mapped | UNVERIFIED | run consumer and a11y audit |
| MAR-NFR-005 | retention/recovery controls | operational files observed where noted | recovery exercise not mapped | UNVERIFIED | define targets and evidence |

Inspected baseline: Marketing site has 222 implementation files/4 tests, 142 app files and a local Prisma schema with Tenant, Domain, Setting, User, Lead and Ticket models.

## Requirement coverage gaps

These requirements are linked to their owning architecture and live repository baseline, but behavioral proof has not yet been mapped. They remain gaps, not implemented claims.
