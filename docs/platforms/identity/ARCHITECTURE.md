# Identity Platform Architecture and TRD

## Boundary

This platform owns authentication, federation, OIDC/OAuth, sessions, tokens, MFA, onboarding, provisioning, entitlement and delegation. It consumes other platforms only through published contracts; repository proximity or direct imports do not transfer ownership.

## Required design views

- actor, tenant and provider trust zones;
- owned resources and lifecycle state machines;
- synchronous APIs, events and integration dependencies;
- persistent data ownership and retention;
- failure, retry, idempotency and reconciliation paths;
- deployment topology, scaling and recovery;
- implementation-to-test evidence.

## Architecture rules

Business invariants execute in authoritative services, authorization is server-side, tenant context is verified rather than client-trusted, and asynchronous effects carry correlation/causation. Shared behavior is consumed from its owning platform rather than copied.

Primary implementation: `idp`, `auth`.

Inspected evidence: IDP has 135 implementation files/26 tests with auth, OAuth, SSO, OIDC authorization/token/session, signing keys, platform entitlements and agent delegation. Auth package has token/session types and 2 tests.

Current risk: Identity data ownership and administration boundaries span tenant/provider surfaces; complete protocol conformance and key-rotation exercises are not yet evidenced.
