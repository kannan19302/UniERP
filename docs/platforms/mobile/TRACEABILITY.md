# Mobile Client Traceability

| Requirement | Architecture/control | Implementation evidence | Test evidence | Status | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MOB-BR-001 | owned lifecycle/state model | `unierp-mobile` inspected | not fully mapped | UNVERIFIED | generate lifecycle inventory |
| MOB-BR-002 | tenant/audit controls | relevant source signals observed | coverage not proven | PARTIAL | map isolation and audit tests |
| MOB-FR-001 | platform service/UI flow | implementation files observed | test inventory counted | UNVERIFIED | inspect behavioral assertions |
| MOB-API-001 | published schemas and errors | package/controller/type signals observed | contract coverage not mapped | PARTIAL | generate endpoint-contract matrix |
| MOB-SEC-001 | IAM policy enforcement | auth/guard usage not fully inventoried | negative tests not mapped | UNVERIFIED | create permission matrix |
| MOB-UX-004 | shared design/accessibility | UI dependency/use not fully measured | workflow evidence not mapped | UNVERIFIED | run consumer and a11y audit |
| MOB-NFR-005 | retention/recovery controls | operational files observed where noted | recovery exercise not mapped | UNVERIFIED | define targets and evidence |

Inspected baseline: Flutter client has 818 implementation files/29 tests and a large GoRouter configuration. Breadth is substantial but parity, offline and platform security evidence remain unmapped.

## Requirement coverage gaps

These requirements are linked to their owning architecture and live repository baseline, but behavioral proof has not yet been mapped. They remain gaps, not implemented claims.
