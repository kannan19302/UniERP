# Marketplace Architecture and TRD

## Boundary

This platform owns listing, review, approval, commercial terms, versioning, installation, upgrade, suspension and uninstall lifecycle. It consumes other platforms only through published contracts; repository proximity or direct imports do not transfer ownership.

## Required design views

- actor, tenant and provider trust zones;
- owned resources and lifecycle state machines;
- synchronous APIs, events and integration dependencies;
- persistent data ownership and retention;
- failure, retry, idempotency and reconciliation paths;
- deployment topology, scaling and recovery;
- implementation-to-test evidence.

## Architecture rules

Business invariants execute in authoritative services, authorization is server-side, tenant context is verified rather than client-trusted, and asynchronous effects carry correlation/causation. Shared behavior is consumed from its owning platform rather than copied.

Primary implementation: `marketplace`, `extensions`, API marketplace/extension-registry modules.

Inspected evidence: Marketplace app has 34 implementation files/1 test; extensions have 36/5 across healthcare, education, field service and real estate. Catalog data appears local in the UI while registry/service modules also exist.

Current risk: Catalog authority is split and local UI data may not reflect registry truth; commercial and technical lifecycle evidence is sparse.
